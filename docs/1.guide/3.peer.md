# Peer

> Peer object allows easily interacting with connected clients.

Websocket [hooks](/guide/hooks) accept a peer instance as their first argument. You can use peer object to get information about each connected client or send a message to them.

> [!TIP]
> You can safely log a peer instance to the console using `console.log` it will be automatically stringified with useful information including the remote address and connection status!

## API

### `peer.send(message, compress)`

Send a message to the connected client

### `peer.addr`

The peer address (might be `undefined`)

### `peer.id`

A unique id assigned to the peer.

### `peer.readyState`

Client connection status (might be `undefined`)

### `peer.ctx`

`peer.ctx` is an object that holds adapter specific context. It is scoped with `peer.ctx.[name]`.

> [!NOTE]
> `ctx`` is an advanced namespace and API changes might happen, so don't rely on it as much as possible!

### `peer.subscribe(channel)`

Join a broadcast channel.

### `peer.unsubscribe(channel)`

Leave a broadcast channel.

:read-more{to="/guide/pubsub"}

### `peer.publish(channel, message)`
