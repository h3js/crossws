## v0.3.0

[compare changes](https://github.com/unjs/crossws/compare/v0.2.4...v0.3.0)

## üåü What is new?

### Better stability

Crossws 0.3.x includes an overhaul of refactors, stability improvements, and new features. A new codebase and testing matrix had been implemented ([#55](https://github.com/unjs/crossws/pull/55)) to make sure all supported adapters and runtimes work as expected and are consistent with each other.

### Refined Peer API

The peer object allows easy interaction with connected WebSocket clients from server route hooks ([peer docs](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/peer)).

To improve Web standards compatibility, accessing upgrade URL and headers is now possible with `peer.request.url` and `peer.request.headers` (**breaking change**), and `peer.addr` is also renamed to `peer.remoteAddress` to improve readability (**breaking change**) and support is increased across providers. You can also use new lazy-generated and secure `peer.id` (UUID v4) for various purposes including temporary sessions or persistent state.

Two new methods are now supported to close connected peers using `peer.close(code, reason)` and `peer.terminate()`. With this new version, you can access a standard [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) interface using `peer.websocket`.

> [!NOTE]
> Today many of the server runtimes don't provide a spec-compliant `WebSocket` API. Crossws uses an internal proxy to polyfill consistent access to `extensions`, `protocol`, and `readyState`. See [compatibility table](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/peer#compatibility) for more details.

### Refined Message API

On `message` [hook](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/hooks), you receive a message object containing data from the client ([message docs](https://crossws.unjs.io/guide/message)).

Parsing incoming messages can be tricky across runtimes. Message object now has stable methods `.text()`, `.json()`, `.uint8Array()`, `.arrayBuffer()`, `.blob()` to safely read message as desired format. If you need, you can also access `.rawData`, `.peer`, `.event` (if available), and lazy generated secure UUID v4 `.id`

### Authentication via `upgrade` hook

When you need to authenticate and validate WebSocket clients before they can upgrade, you can now easily use the `upgrade` hook to check incoming URLs and headers/cookies and return a Web Standard [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) in case you need to abort the upgrade.

### Pubsub with Deno and Cloudflare Durable Objects

One of the common use cases of WebSockets is pubsub. This release adds pub-sub support to [Deno provider](https://crossws.unjs.io/adapters/deno) and also you can globally broadcast messages using `ws.publish` for advanced use cases.

Normally with cloudflare workers, it is not possible to connect multiple peers with each other. Cloudflare [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) (available on paid plans) allows building collaborative editing tools, interactive chat, multiplayer games, and applications that need coordination among multiple clients.

Crossws provides a new composable method to easily integrate WebSocket handlers with Durable Objects. Hibernation is supported out of the box to reduce billing costs when connected clients are inactive. ([durable object peer docs](https://crossws.unjs.io/adapters/cloudflare#durable-objects))
